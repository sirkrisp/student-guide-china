# General Travel Tips

- **Don't forget your student card**: Bachelor students often enjoy huge discounts (up to 50%). Your digital student pass is in most cases not accepted.
- **Travel in groups of 2 or 4** for the following reasons:
    - Taking the cab with 4 is often cheaper than taking a tourist bus (and way more convenient)
    - Many activities are tailored for couples
