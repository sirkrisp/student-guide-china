# Chinese Bank Account

## For X1 Visa Holders

For X1 Visa holders it's relatively easy to obtain a Chinese bank account. In particular, no residence permit is needed at the point of opening a bank account (it's enough to present your X2 student Visa documents). However, you might need to go to a bank branch that's affiliated with your university if you have no residence permit yet. Lastly, make sure you have a Chinese mobile number before opening your Chinese bank account.

## For X2 Visa Holders

Officially, you cannot open a bank account with an X2 Visa. However, you might still be able to open a Chinese bank account in less well-known banks or off city center bank branches. For short-term stays (up to 3 months) it is recommended to use the **Alipay Tour Pass** (see [here](https://wise.com/us/blog/alipay-tour-pass) for more info) instead of opening a Chinese bank account.
