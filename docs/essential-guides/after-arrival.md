# After China Arrival

After your China arrival, follow these steps (in the given order):

1. Check in to your dormitory
    1. If you are an X1 student visa holder ask the staff at the reception to hand you the "Application for Residence Permit" document and make sure there is a stamp from the nearby police station on it. Also, check that the info on that document is really correct.
2. Get a Chinese phone number, for example, at China Mobile. The staff at China Mobile does not speak English so be prepared to use some translation software if you are not fluent in speaking Chinese.
3. Change the phone number associated with your WeChat and Alipay account. Make sure that you don't lose any important contacts in WeChat when changing your phone number (If in doubt, don't change your phone number in WeChat).
3. If you are an X1 student visa holder, it's now time to [open a Chinese bank account](../bank-account). Link your bank account with WeChat and Alipay.
4. Install all [essential apps](../apps) (conveniently, in most Chinese apps you can register using your Alipay or WeChat account) *and* the app of your university to obtain your **digital student ID** which is most likely required to enter your university campus.
5. Register at the university and obtain your **physical student ID** at the administration office of your school. Make sure they also hand you a document that confirms your semester registration (might apply for full-time students only).
6. If you are an X1 visa holder, it's now time to obtain your **residence permit** (you must *apply* for the residence permit within 30 days after your China arrival):
    1. Before applying for the residence permit, you must go through the **physical health examination**. In most cities, you can make an appointment for the physical health examination online. You will receive the results by post within two weeks.
    2. After receiving the physical health examination records, you can now **apply for the residence permit** at the nearest police station in your district with the following documents:
        - Passport
        - X1 visa documents
        - school approval
        - Application for Residence Permit (see point 1.a)
        - Physical Health Examination Records
