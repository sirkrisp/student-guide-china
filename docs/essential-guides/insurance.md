# Insurance

If you are a full-time in China you might need to change your location of residence to China. In that case, you must likely cancel the insurance in your current home country and get a new insurance in China. Here are some options:

- AXA global health insurance (recommended)
- Chinese Insurance lxbx.net (included with most Chinese scholarships) does not cover much, though dental care is provided (600 RMB). Unfortunately, this insurance makes it very complicated to claim money as all documents need to be send by courrier to their office.
