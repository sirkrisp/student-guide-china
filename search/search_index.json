Also, check that the info on that document is really correct. Get a Chinese phone number, for example, at China Mobile. The staff at China Mobile does not speak English so be prepared to use some translation software if you are not fluent in speaking Chinese. Change the phone number associated with your WeChat and Alipay account. Make sure that you don't lose any important contacts in WeChat when changing your phone number (If in doubt, don't change your phone number in WeChat). If you are an X1 student visa holder, it's now time to open a Chinese bank account . Link your bank account with WeChat and Alipay.

In most cities, you can make an appointment for the physical health examination online. You will receive the results by post within two weeks.
